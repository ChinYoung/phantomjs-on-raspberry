# phantomjs-on-raspberry (pi 2/wheezy)
[Phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) *unofficial* binaries for arm based raspberry pi 2 running raspbian/wheezy.

Packages were build on a raspberry pi 2 running wheezy raspbian (2015-05-05) from the PhantomJS
[source](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs). Each directory contains a README.md
file that discribes how binaries were build and so, how you can do it yourself
if you are not confortable with unofficial packages. Debian packages were created with
`fpm` and install `phantomjs` in `/usr/bin/`.
