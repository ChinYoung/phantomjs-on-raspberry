# phantomjs-on-raspberry
[Phantomjs](http://http://phantomjs.org/) *unofficial* binaries for arm based raspberry pi.

Phantomjs doesn't provide packages for arm, so these packages are here
to allow easy install of recent versions.

Packages were build on a raspberry pi 2 running raspbian (2015-05-05) from the Phantomjs
[source](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs). Each directory contains a README.md
file that discribes how binaries were build and so, how you can do it yourself
if you are not confortable with unofficial packages.
